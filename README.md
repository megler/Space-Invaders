# Space-Invaders
Fun with CSS and Javascript.  This is a very basic one level Space Invaders game. It isn't meant to be a fully functioning game. This was a challenge on what I felt I could achieve using CSS and JS without any plugins or game based addons. (Like Phaser).

## Goal

See what I could create using just CSS and JS without game-based addons such as Phaser.  This site does use one plugin called Alertify for custom dialog boxes.

## What I Learned

- Basic game looping
- Thinking through cause and effect programming (how to get an element to react to a specific input or event)
- HTML5 Canvas
- The old games are still the best!
